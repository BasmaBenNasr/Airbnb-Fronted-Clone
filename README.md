#### this is the frontend of the application 
when you caan see the UI like airbnb

######
In this App ("airbnb")
- I tried to imitate the airbnb website using the technologies :
# Sanity
In this app I build an AirBnB Clone, as well as manage all the data visually. I build a backend for the app that defines the relationships between  data thanks to Schemas and Types, and add data using Sanity Studio ( https://www.sanity.io/ )

# Next.js

using Next.js which is a React framework that gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.



######
To open my project on the fronted just run the CLI: npm run dev
For the backend : npm start

I wrote the same thing in the Readme of front and back end to not have a confusion
